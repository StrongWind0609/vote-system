## Key Features Implementation

### 1. Custom Hooks for Voting Logic

The `useVoting` hook provides single vote restriction with global state management:

```typescript
const { hasVoted, isSubmitting, error, hasVotedForOther, handleVote, resetVote } = useVoting(contestantId);
```

### 2. Error Boundaries

Comprehensive error handling with fallback UIs:

```typescript
<ErrorBoundary>
  <ComponentThatMightFail />
</ErrorBoundary>
```

### 3. Responsive Design

Mobile-first approach with CSS Grid and media queries:

```css
.contestants-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
  gap: 2rem;
}
```

### 4. Single Vote Restriction

Global vote state that restricts users to one vote total:

```typescript
// Global vote state tracks which contestant was voted for
// All other contestants show "Already Voted" after a vote is cast
// Vote state persists across page reloads using localStorage
```

### 5. Real-time Updates

Polling-based live data updates every 5 seconds:

```typescript
const { contestants, votingWindow, isLoading, error, refetch } = useContestants(5000);
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/StrongWind0609/vote-system.git
cd vote-system
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the development server:

## Testing

The application includes comprehensive tests covering:

- **Component Tests**: UI behavior and user interactions
- **Hook Tests**: State management and localStorage persistence
- **Utility Tests**: API and storage functions
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end functionality

### Key Test Scenarios

1. **Single Vote Restriction**: Users can only vote for one contestant total
2. **Vote Button Behavior**: Shows "Voted ✓" for voted contestant, "Already Voted" for others
3. **localStorage Persistence**: Vote state persists across browser sessions
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of network failures and vote restrictions
5. **Responsive Design**: UI adapts to different screen sizes
6. **Real-time Updates**: Live data updates work correctly

## Development Prompts Used

### 1. Initial Project Setup
```
Test Assignment:
Build a system that allows the public to vote live for contestants during an America's Got Talent-style show.
The app should display a list of active contestants, let users cast limited votes during a live voting window, and update in real time to reflect current vote trends or statuses.
It should be reliable, responsive across devices, and handle failure gracefully.
Use React with NextJS

Requirements:
1. Create reusable custom hooks to manage contestant voting logic, ensuring state is isolated per contestant and scalable across the app.
2. Implement error boundaries to catch and display fallback UIs when parts of the app fail, such as data fetch or vote submission.
3. Design a responsive layout so the voting interface adapts smoothly across mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes.
4. Validate and handle form input to enforce vote limits, prevent duplicate votes, and give clear user feedback on errors.
5. Simulate live data updates (e.g. changing vote counts) using polling or timers to mimic real-time voting behavior.
6. Structure components and state to reflect a clean separation of concerns and testable logic.
7. Gracefully handle loading and failure states so the system remains usable and informative even under degraded conditions.

Deliver:
1. Proper specification: business and technical
2. All prompts used to code the assignment
3. Folder with the app
4. Tests that the "Vote" button disables after voting and remains disabled even after a page reload, using localStorage to persist vote state.
```

### 2. Business and Technical Specification
```
Create a comprehensive specification document that includes:
- Business requirements for the voting system
- Technical requirements and architecture
- Component structure and data flow
- Error handling strategies
- Testing approach
- Performance considerations
```

### 3. TypeScript Type Definitions
```
Create TypeScript interfaces for:
- Contestant data structure with id, name, talent, imageUrl, voteCount, isActive
- Vote state management with contestantId, hasVoted, timestamp
- API responses with data, success, message
- Error states with hasError, message, retry function
- Voting window with isOpen, startTime, endTime
```

### 4. Custom Hooks Development
```
Create custom React hooks for:
1. useVoting hook:
   - Isolated voting logic per contestant
   - localStorage persistence for vote state
   - Error handling for vote submission
   - Loading states during submission
   - Prevention of duplicate votes

2. useContestants hook:
   - Real-time data fetching with polling
   - Error handling for network failures
   - Loading states

- Maintains app stability even when components fail
```

### 6. Storage Utility Functions
```
Create utility functions for localStorage management:
- getVoteState: Retrieve vote state for a specific contestant
- setVoteState: Save vote state for a contestant
- clearVoteStates: Clear all vote states
- Error handling for localStorage failures
- JSON parsing with error recovery
- Timestamp management for vote tracking
```

### 7. API Simulation Functions
```
Create mock API functions that simulate:
- Network delays and realistic response times
- Random network errors (10% failure rate)
- Real-time vote count updates
- Contestant data with realistic information
- Voting window management
- Error responses with meaningful messages
```

### 8. Responsive Contestant Card Component
```
Create a responsive contestant card component with:
- Mobile-first design approach
- CSS Grid/Flexbox layout
- Smooth hover animations
- Image error handling with fallbacks
- Vote button with different states (enabled, disabled, voted, submitting)
- Error message display
- Voting window status indicators
- Accessible UI elements
```

### 9. Main Voting Interface Component
```
Create the main voting interface component that:
- Displays all contestants in a responsive grid
- Shows voting window status
- Handles loading states with spinners
- Displays error states with retry options
- Updates in real-time with polling
- Adapts to different screen sizes
- Provides clear user feedback
```

### 10. Testing Strategy
